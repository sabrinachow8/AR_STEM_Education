# AR_STEM_Education

The AR STEM Education project is an iOS application created in XCode to be an immersive and interactive learning experience. This was specifically coded to be used in the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC) as a part of the outreach program.

This AR application was designed as a part of the 2023 VR-REU run by Professor Wole. As the name suggests, the summer program is an REU, i.e. Research Experience for Undergraduates, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). This project specifically was supervised by Kendra Krueger.
